1. Determine the Trend:
   - Identify the main trend by looking for impulse and correction waves in the price action.
   - Focus on trading when the market is trending.

   - Look for price breaking through key support or resistance levels.
   - After a breakout, wait for the price to pull back and retest the breakout area.

   - The bullish engulfing pattern consists of a smaller bearish candle followed by a larger bullish candle.
   - Enter the trade at the close of the bullish engulfing candle.

   - The bearish engulfing pattern consists of a smaller bullish candle followed by a larger bearish candle.
   - Enter the trade at the close of the bearish engulfing candle.

5. Stop Loss and Take Profit:
   - Place the stop loss below the low of the bullish engulfing candle for long positions and above the high of the bearish engulfing candle for short positions.
   - Take profit at a ratio of 1:2 or 1:3 relative to the stop loss distance.

6. Additional Considerations:
   - Set alerts to be notified of potential breakout and retest opportunities.
   - The strategy can be implemented on any time frame, from one minute to monthly charts.
